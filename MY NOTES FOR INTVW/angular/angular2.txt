           As the name suggests, @ContentChild and @ContentChildren queries will 
            return directives existing inside the <ng-content></ng-content> 
             element of your view, whereas @ViewChild and @ViewChildren 
              only look at elements that are on your view template directly.

    *. what is view child ?
           @ViewChild is a local component template querying mechanism, 
           that cannot see the internals of its child components.
